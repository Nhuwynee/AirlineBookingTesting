# ✈️ Airline Booking Website Testing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **software testing** for an airline ticket booking system.  
It was conducted as part of the **Software Testing course project** at the University of Danang – University of Technology and Education.

The testing process covers the entire booking flow, including:
1. **Passengers** – entering traveler details.  
2. **Add-ons** – selecting extra services (baggage, seat selection, meals, insurance, etc.).  
3. **Review** – verifying booking summary, prices, and services before payment.  
4. **Payment** – validating multiple payment methods and input constraints.

## 🛠️ Requirements & Features Tested
- Passenger details validation (name, date of birth, nationality, passport, KrisFlyer number, etc.).  
- Add-ons testing: baggage, seat selection, meal selection, Wi-Fi, insurance, and more.  
- Review functionality: ensuring correct calculation of fares, add-on services, promotions, and booking summary.  
- Payment process: validating fields (credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, PayNow, etc.), vouchers, and session timeout handling.  
- System constraints: data format validation, mandatory fields, duplicate prevention, session expiration after inactivity.

## ✅ Test Cases
- Designed and executed test cases for each booking step.  
- Covered both **positive and negative scenarios** (valid input, missing data, special characters, incorrect formats, expired session handling, etc.).  
- Documented expected results and actual outcomes (Pass/Fail).
